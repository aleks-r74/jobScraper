What is it?
This web app was built as a personal AI Assistant to showcase my development skills.

What problem does it solve?
It saves my time by autonomously parsing job postings and making human-like decisions about them, thanks to an LLM (Large Language Model).

What technology does it use?
The emphasis in this project is on back-end technology.
